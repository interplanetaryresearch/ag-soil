**Astronomical Data Systems**, references such as `SIMBAD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMBAD>`_, `NASA/IPAC
Extragalactic Database <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA/IPAC_Extragalactic_Database>`_,
and `Astrophysics Data System <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysics_Data_System>`_.

**Bibcode**, (also known as the refcode) is a compact identifier used by
several astronomical data systems to uniquely specify literature references.

    The code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form

        YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA

    *YYYY*: Four-digit year of the reference
    *JJJJJ*: A code indicating where the reference was published
    *VVVV*: In the case of a journal reference, VVVV is the volume number
    *M*: Section of the journal where the reference was published
    *PPPP*: Starting page number
    *A*: First letter of the last name of the first author

**Digital object identifier**, a persistent identifier or handle used to
uniquely identify objects, standardized by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO). (`See ISO 26324:2012(en) <https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:26324:ed-1:v1:en>`_)

**Particle Size**, refers to the diameter of individual grains of sediment, or
the lithified particles in clastic rocks. Granular material can range from very
small colloidal particles, through clay, silt, sand, gravel, and cobbles, to
boulders. (`1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_size>`_)

**Pedogenesis**, is the process of soil formation as regulated by the effects
of place, environment, and history. See `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedogenesis>`_
for more information on Pedogensis.

**Wentworth Scale** is a logarithmic scale created for the purpose of defining
a range of sizes, limits, and classes to help us better understand soils
scientifically. See also ISO 14688-1:2002
