**Particle Size**, refers to the diameter of individual grains of sediment, or
the lithified particles in clastic rocks. Granular material can range from very
small colloidal particles, through clay, silt, sand, gravel, and cobbles, to
boulders. (`1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_size#Krumbein_Phi_Scale-United_States>`)

**Pedogenesis**, is the process of soil formation as regulated by the effects
of place, environment, and history. See `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedogenesis>`_
for more information on Pedogensis.

**Wentworth Scale** is a logarithmic scale created for the purpose of defining
a range of sizes, limits, and classes to help us better understand soils
scientifically.
