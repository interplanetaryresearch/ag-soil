Nutrients Required By Plants
----------------------------
Plants require fifteen (15) essential nutrient elements to grow properly.

Three (3) of these fifteen (15) nutrient elements are obtained from the
atmosphere through photosynthesis.

1. Hydrogen
2. Oxygen
3. Carbon

The remaining twelve (12) nutrient elements are obtained from the soil. These
remaining nutrient elements are separated into three (3) groups.

**Group I** Primary Nutrients
4. Nitrogen
    Abbreviation: N
    Form Absorbed: NH :sub:`4` :sup:`+` (ammonium) and NO :sub:`3` :sup:`-` (nitrate)
5. Phosphorus†
6. Potassium

**Group II** Intermediate Nutrients
7. Sulfur
8. Magnesium
9. Calcium

**Group III** Micronutrients
10. Iron
11. Boron
12. Manganese
13. Zinc
14. Molybdeum
15. Copper

**Other Commonly Occurring Nutrients**
16. Cobalt
17. Chlorine
18. Nickel
